# Exploratory Data Analysis on Berkeley Earth Dataset

### Introduction
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data analysis process, aimed at understanding and deriving insights from datasets. This project focuses on the Berkeley Earth dataset, which provides high-resolution land and ocean time series data and gridded temperature data, essential for understanding climate trends.

### Objective
The objective of this project is to perform EDA on the Berkeley Earth dataset, focusing on a specific region, and to analyze the correlations and patterns between climate data and two additional time series datasets related to the chosen region. The project aims to uncover insights and trends through comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

### Key Features
1. **Region Selection**: Choose a specific region (e.g., a country or city) for focused analysis, with a clear rationale for selection.
2. **Data Download**: Acquire the Berkeley Earth dataset and two additional time series datasets relevant to the chosen region, stating the sources clearly.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Conduct EDA on the Berkeley Earth dataset to identify climate trends, seasonal variations, and long-term patterns. Perform inter-dataset EDA to explore correlations between the Berkeley Earth data and the additional datasets.
4. **Dashboard Creation**: Develop a minimum of two Tableau stories, each containing multiple dashboards, addressing specific research questions and insights.
5. **Beautiful Dashboard Designs**: Create aesthetically pleasing dashboards with thoughtful design elements.
6. **Compelling and Insightful Visual Storytelling**: Utilize Tableau's storytelling feature to create compelling visual stories that guide users through the analysis, highlighting key insights and providing explanations.

### Project Components
- **Tableau Workspace (*.twbx)**: Contains all dashboards and visualizations.
- **PDF Document**: Describes the analysis process, addressed questions, correlations, insights discovered, and rationale for dashboard design choices.
- **Datasets**: Included in the ZIP file or instructions on where to access them.

### How to Run
1. Download the datasets from the specified sources.
2. Open the Tableau workspace file in Tableau.
3. Review the dashboards and visual stories to explore the analysis and insights.
4. Refer to the PDF document for a detailed explanation of the analysis process and findings.

This project demonstrates the power of EDA in uncovering climate trends and insights, integrating multiple datasets to provide a comprehensive analysis and compelling visual storytelling.
